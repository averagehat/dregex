/**
 * A meta regular expression is the intersection or subtraction of 2 other (meta or simple) regular expressions.
 * Lookaround constructions are transformed in equivalent meta simple regular expressions for processing.
 *
 * A(?=B)C is transformed into AC âˆ© AB.*
 * A(?!B)C is transformed into AC - AB.*
 *
 * In the case of more than one lookaround, the transformation is applied recursively.
 *
 * This works if A is of known length
 *
 * Only top level lookarounds that are part of a juxtaposition are permitted, i.e. they are no allowed inside
 * parenthesis, nested or as members of a conjunction. Examples:
 *
 * Allowed:
 * A(?!B)C
 * (?!B)C
 *
 * Not allowed:
 * (?!B)|B     part of a conjuction
 * (?!(?!B))   lookaround inside lookaround
 * (A(?!B))B   lookaround inside parenthesis
 *
 * NOTE: Only lookahead is currently implemented
